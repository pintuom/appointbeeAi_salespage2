        <p>For more general information on cookies see the Wikipedia article on HTTP Cookies.</p>
        <h5><strong>How We Use Cookies</strong></h5>
        <p>We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately, in most cases there are no industry standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features they add to this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure whether you need them or not in case they are used to provide a service that you use.</p>
        <h5><strong>Disabling Cookies</strong></h5>
        <p>You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see your browser Help for how to do this).

        <h5><strong>Email newsletters related cookies</strong></h5>
        <p>This site offers newsletter or email subscription services and cookies may be used to remember if you are already registered and whether to show certain notifications which might only be valid to subscribed/unsubscribed users.</p>
        <h5><strong>Orders processing related cookies</strong></h5>

        <p>In some special cases, we also use cookies provided by trusted third parties. The following section details which third party cookies you might encounter through this site.</p>
        <p>This site uses Google Analytics which is one of the most widespread and trusted analytics solutions on the web for helping us to understand how you use the site and ways that we can improve your experience. These cookies may track things such as how long you spend on the site and the pages that you visit so we can continue to produce engaging content.</p>
        <p>For more information on Google Analytics cookies, see the official Google Analytics page.</p>
        <p>From time to time we test new features and make subtle changes to the way that the site is delivered. When we are still testing new features these cookies may be used to ensure that you receive a consistent experience whilst on the site whilst ensuring we understand which optimizations our users appreciate the most.</p>
        <p>As we sell products it’s important for us to understand statistics about how many of the visitors to our site actually make a purchase and as such this is the kind of data that these cookies will track. This is important to you as it means that we can accurately make business predictions that allow us to monitor our advertising and product costs to ensure the best possible price.</p>
        <h5><strong>More Information</strong></h5>
        <p>Hopefully, that has clarified things for you and as was previously mentioned if there is something that you aren’t sure whether you need or not it’s usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case it does interact with one of the features you use on our site.</p>
